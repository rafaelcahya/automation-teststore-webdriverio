## 🧪 Automation Testing with WebdriverIO + Automation Test Store
Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my automation testing project using WebdriverIO. In this repo, I’m testing a real-world-like e-commerce site called Automation Test Store.

The whole setup is integrated with Jenkins, so tests can run automatically every time I push an update. It's designed to keep everything clean, fast, and reliable — and yes, it’s super developer-friendly.

## 🎯 What’s This Project All About?
I created this project to test the core e-commerce flows using WebdriverIO:
1. 🔐 Login – Making sure the sign-in process works
2. 🆕 Register – Verifying new user registration
3. 🔍 Product Detail – Checking product detail pages
4. 🛒 Cart – Testing add-to-cart functionality
5. 💳 Checkout Flow – Simulating a full purchase process

## 🧰 Tools I’m Using
Here’s what powers this project:
1. WebdriverIO – My main test automation framework
2. Jenkins – For running tests automatically in CI/CD
3. Automation Test Store – A free and reliable site for automation testing
